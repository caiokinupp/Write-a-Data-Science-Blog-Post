### Medium Blog Post
Here is the Medium blog post I have written: https://caiokinupp.medium.com/3-curiosities-about-seattle-airbnb-listings-a5c4ffd88c0

### Project Motivation
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I used Seattle Airbnb Dataset for this project. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, the dataset describes the listing activities of homestays in Seattle, WA. The orijinal dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle

This project focuses on answering following questions: “What are the most common amenities that are available in Seattle Airbnb dataset?” "What most attracts the guests for renting a property?" “What are the most influential features of the dataset to estimate the price of a listing?”

### Libraries
I use Python 3 to do the analysis. Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- matplotlib.pyplot
- Math

### File Descriptions
- seattle_airbnb_analysis.ipynb Jupyter notebook with complete analysis, answers to the questions, explanations and visualisations

- listings.csv Original dataset in csv format
